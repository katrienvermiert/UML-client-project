# Clientâ€™s needs

## ZikFreak

ZikFreak is a company that let recordingstudio's in Brussels rent their studio to muscicians. We will make a website where musicians can find a studio that's available for recording, but also where recordingstudio's can advertise their place and rent it. So it must appeal to both audiences. 

For musicians we will make the website that's accessible and customisable to their needs. They can adjust their band formation depending on their members and what kind of instrument they play, depending on this information only the recordingstudio's with enough space or can handle the output in decibells will be shown as available places for rent.

For recordingstudio's we will create an environment where they can post their studio, post pictures and fill in specific details about the place. They can also manage the studio's availability, pricing and see when people want to rent the studio.
